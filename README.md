### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”Ž Solving problems is one of the most atractives activities, or at least that's what I think. That reason was my motivation to become a mechanical engineer.

ðŸš€ My fascination for finding solutions led me to work with research groups in R&D projects during my BSc.

ðŸ’»  As I finished my degree, I decided to complement my career by getting more involved in the technology sector.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about web development and data science.
